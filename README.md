# MNIST_Neural_Network
This is a neural network that has been created to identify hand written numbers from the MNIST data set. 
This project uses the Tensor Flow library in order to create a multi-layer Neural Network.

The data set came from the MNIST data set from this link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html
